Java 2D Game Engine
===================

This project is a more or less complete re-write of Van Zeben's Java 2D Game Engine Tutorials on Youtube
[Here] (http://vanZeben.ca/java/2d_game_dev).  It is intended to be used together with the Game Programming Patterns book [Here] (http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) as a jumping off point for my AP Computer Science Class.
